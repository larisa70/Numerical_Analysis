# Numerical_Analysis
Matlab code for solution of  different problems appearing in numerical analysis: interpolation, integration, solution of nonlinear equations and systems of nonlinear equations; solution of ODE and systems of ODE.

Programs are used in the course MMG410 given at GU, Gothenburg, Sweden

Matlab_Nonlineq.zip -->  programs for solution of nonlinear equations: bisection,secant and Newton's methods

Matlab_Interpolation.zip --> interpolation and problems with interpolation, Chebyshev's points.

Splines.zip ---> example of interpolation of some function using linear splines
Integration.zip  ---> examples of evaluation of integral using composite Rectangle rule, Trapezoidal rule and Simpson's rule. Comparison with computation of the same inegrales using Matlab's functions integral, quadl and trapz.

ODE45.zip ---> examples of solution of ODE and systems of ODE using Matlab's functions ode45, ode23, ode23s and comparison with explicit and implicit Euler's methods.
